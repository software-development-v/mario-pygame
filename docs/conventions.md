# Python Conventions

This document outlines the coding and naming conventions for this project.
Please adhere to these guidelines when contributing.

## Coding Conventions

We follow the
[Pyright strict style guide](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/main/docs/configuration.md)
for our coding conventions. Here are some key points:

- Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
- Lines should be limited to 79 characters.
- Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, as well as large blocks of
  code inside functions.
- When possible, put comments on a line of their own.
- Use docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods.
- Imports should be on separate lines.

## Naming Conventions

- **Variables**: Use a lowercase single letter, word, or words. Separate words
  with underscores to improve readability (e.g., `my_variable`).
- **Functions**: Use a lowercase word or words. Separate words by underscores to
  improve readability (e.g., `my_function`).
- **Classes**: Start each word with a capital letter. Do not separate words with
  underscores. This style is called Camel Case (e.g., `MyClass`).

## File and Directory Conventions

- Use lowercase letters and separate words with underscores (e.g.,
  `my_directory`, `my_file.py`).
- Keep the file and directory names relevant to their purpose.
- Avoid using numbers in file and directory names unless necessary.

## Asset Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase letters and separate words with hyphens (e.g., `my-asset.png`).
- Keep the asset names relevant to their content or usage.
- Avoid using spaces and special characters in asset names.

Remember, consistency with these conventions is key. When in doubt, stick to the
conventions outlined in this document.
